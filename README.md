# GitHub Linkify

> Browser extension that displays a link to GitHub profiles and repos from GitHub Pages

GitHub profile and repo links are sometimes front and center, but not always. This extension detects whenever you're visiting a GitHub Pages site, and adds a quick link to the corresponding profile or repo in the address bar.
